# Windows setup

The Session Recap Bot runs locally on Windows 10/11. This guide gets a development checkout working.
Later tasks add prerequisites (whisper.cpp in T23); they will be documented here.

## 1. Install Node.js 24 LTS

Pick one option.

**winget (simplest):**

```powershell
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e
```

Open a new terminal afterwards and check that `node --version` prints `v24.x`. If the LTS package has
moved past 24, install 24 explicitly with nvm-windows instead.

**nvm-windows (if you need several Node versions):**

```powershell
winget install --id CoreyButler.NVMforWindows -e
# open a new terminal, then:
nvm install 24
nvm use 24
```

The repo pins the major version in `.nvmrc` (`24`) and in `engines` in `package.json`.

## 2. Install Git

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e
```

The repo uses LF line endings (`.gitattributes`: `* text=auto eol=lf`), so `core.autocrlf` doesn't matter.

## 3. Install FFmpeg (ffmpeg + ffprobe)

The audio stages probe, decode (16 kHz mono PCM) and detect silence with FFmpeg. It is an external
prerequisite and is never committed to the repository. **Minimum version: 6.0; 7.0 or newer is
recommended** (before 7.0, ffmpeg prints silence timestamps with only six significant digits, so
boundaries on recordings longer than about 16 minutes are only 10 ms precise).

**winget (simplest):**

```powershell
winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg -e
```

Open a **new** terminal afterwards so the updated `PATH` is picked up, then check:

```powershell
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
```

To upgrade later: `winget upgrade --id Gyan.FFmpeg -e`.

**Manual install (no winget, or a specific build):**

1. Download a release build (`ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip`) from <https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/>
   or <https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases>.
2. Extract it, for example to `C:\Tools\ffmpeg`, so that `C:\Tools\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe` exists.
3. Either add `C:\Tools\ffmpeg\bin` to your user `PATH`, or point recap at the executables directly:

   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('RECAP_FFMPEG', 'C:\Tools\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe', 'User')
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('RECAP_FFPROBE', 'C:\Tools\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe', 'User')
   ```

   Open a new terminal afterwards.

**Lookup order.** recap uses the path from its config file first (T04), then `RECAP_FFMPEG` /
`RECAP_FFPROBE`, then `PATH`. An explicit path that is wrong is reported as an error; recap does not
silently fall back to another ffmpeg on `PATH`. On Windows only `ffmpeg.exe` / `ffprobe.exe` are
accepted, not `.cmd`/`.bat` wrappers, and the current directory is never searched.

Paths with spaces and non-ASCII characters (for example `D:\Sessões\sessão 12\áudio.wav`) work: recap
passes arguments to ffmpeg directly, never through a shell.

## 4. Install dependencies and build

From the repository root:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run build
```

## 5. Check the installation

```powershell
npm run recap -- --help
npm run recap -- doctor
```

`npm exec --no -- recap doctor` works too. Don't use a bare `npx recap`: if the local bin isn't linked,
npx downloads an unrelated `recap` package from the npm registry.

`recap doctor` prints the Node version, the platform, and for ffmpeg and ffprobe whether they were found,
their version and path, and where the path came from (`config`, `env` or `PATH`). A healthy install
looks like this:

```text
recap doctor
  node:     v24.x.x
  platform: win32 x64
  ffmpeg:   ok 7.1.1-essentials_build-www.gyan.dev
            path: C:\Users\you\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Links\ffmpeg.exe (from PATH)
  ffprobe:  ok 7.1.1-essentials_build-www.gyan.dev
            path: C:\Users\you\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Links\ffprobe.exe (from PATH)
  result:   ok
```

If a tool is missing or older than 6.0, doctor prints `MISSING` or `UNUSABLE` with a `fix:` line.
Plain `recap doctor` always exits 0. Use `recap doctor --strict` in scripts: it exits 1 when a check
fails.

## 6. Development commands

| Command                | What it does                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `npm test`             | Vitest (unit tests + CLI smoke test)          |
| `npm run lint`         | ESLint                                        |
| `npm run typecheck`    | TypeScript, no emit                           |
| `npm run build`        | Compile `packages/*/src` to `packages/*/dist` |
| `npm run format`       | Prettier, write                               |
| `npm run format:check` | Prettier, check only (CI)                     |

The audio integration tests generate synthetic sine + silence WAVs with ffmpeg at test time. Without
ffmpeg they are skipped locally (the test run prints `[audio integration] SKIPPED`); in CI, where the
workflow installs ffmpeg, they must run.

## Data location

Never put real session recordings or transcripts inside the repository. `sessions/`, audio files,
transcripts, SQLite databases and `.env*` files are git-ignored as a safety net. The default data root
outside the repo is defined in T25.
